# Amazon UI Clone
For this project, I undertook the task of replicating the user interface (UI) of Amazon.com using only HTML and CSS. The primary goal was to develop a visually similar layout and design, focusing on the main components such as the header, navigation menu, product grid, and footer.
The project began with analysing the structure and styling of Amazon's website. Using HTML, I structured the layout by dividing it into logical sections, such as header, navigation, product grid, and footer.
CSS was then utilized to style the HTML elements, mimicking Amazon's visual aesthetics. This included setting fonts, colours, spacing, and positioning to closely resemble the original website.
Through this project, I gained valuable experience in HTML and CSS, particularly in structuring layouts and applying styling techniques. While it's a simplified version of Amazon's UI, it serves as a practical exercise in web development and UI design.
